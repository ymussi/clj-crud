# clj-crud

- Clone this project in your home;
- Assuming you have already installed Leiningen and MySQL, configure your database on "src/clj-crud/conector/conn.clj";
- On this example, we have two tables. The first table we called "clojure" and three columns: id, title, description, and the second we called "gerenciador". See her schema.;
- After that, just open the project on the terminal and run the command: lein run;

Thats it! The API Swagger is on running.
